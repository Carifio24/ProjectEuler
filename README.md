# Project Euler

This repository contains my personal solutions to Project Euler problems. I usually try to make my solutions reasonably efficient, but I'm more interested in solving the problems rather than optimizing as much as possible. I also try to restrict myself to standard libraries, unless something's going to be a real pain to write out myself.

I've been primarily using Python, but I'll throw some C++ and Java (and maybe something else like Swift) in there for fun.

## Running the files

### Python
Just running ``python3 problem_X.py`` should do the trick. I use Python 3.5, but I don't imagine there will be many version-related issues.

## C++
I'm using g++ 7.4 with the C++17 standard on Ubuntu 16.04, so ``g++ problem_X.cpp -std=c++17`` should get the job done. Compiled binaries are included in the repo, but they may or may not work on your system.
